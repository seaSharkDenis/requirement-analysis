# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

This repository serves as a comprehensive guide and working project on **Requirment Analysis**- a foundational phase in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC). Focusing on the AirBnB Clone case study, it demonstrates how to identify, document, and structure both functional and non-functional requirements.

## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is a critical phase in the software development lifecycle (SDLC) where the project team gathers, analyzes, and defines the requirements of the software product to be developed. This process ensures that all stakeholders have a clear and mutual understanding of what the system should do and how it should perform.

### Importance of Requirements Analysis in SDLC
1. **Foundation for Development** - Requirement analysis provided the blueprint for what needs to be built. Without a clear understanding of the system's purpose and scope, the software may not solve the intended problems or meet user expectations.
2. **Reduce Cost and Rework** - Identifying requirements early helps catch inconsistencies, ambiguities, or misunderstandings before development begins. Changes made during the analysis phase are far less costly than those made during development or after deployment.
3. **Drived Design and Testing** - Well-defined requirements influence system architecture and guide test case development. Acceptance criteria derived from requirements ensure that testing aligns with business needs.
